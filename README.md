# SharpCAT
C#, .NET Standard based CAT control llibrary.
I am targeting .Net Standard so that the assembly may be used with .Net Core or the .Net framework.

I'm starting with the FT818, I then plan on adding my ID-4100a, and TH-D74A.

If you wish to help, hit me up, or create a pull request.

# Why?
Yes, there's Hamlib, and yes there's HamLibSharp.

I don't speak C++ and PInvoke is nasty.
That being said, there's also not a pure .Net (C#) CAT control lib out there that I know of.
